## Let's get

# SELFISH ü¶û

<Notes>

Being a creator is such an odd mix of empathy and selfishness. So practice the one you have the hard time with. Often society promotes empathy and togetherness over all (which in many cases is better than selfishness. But as we will see, you build for you, so get selfish.

### Discussion

# Why are you building?

<Notes>

  Take a minute, write down why you think you are building

</Notes>

---

## Heads up, it's ramble time.

---

<Steps>

* What does "Build" mean?
* How does understanding __"Why"__ help?
* What should your project do?
* How do I find my why?

</Steps>


<Notes>

  Options for concrete examples:
   * writing for a blog
   * a specific product (keep more connected with my partner)

  * This leads us to believe that building 1) is meant for other people, 2) is supposed to make money, and 3) has to be hand crafted - usually with code. How do you want to define it for yourself

  * Helps you make decisions, with less effort. Relate possibly to values

  * Scope is often something that we as humans, creators, and dreamers have a hard time defining. What does our project do? It is a really hard question, and that question isn't static. You don't just decide on scope once, you constantly evaluate: What am I building? Is it the right thing? Should I add x feature now, later, or never? Should I stop this and pivot? I could go on. So how then do we keep focused?

  * Is it money? Is it for fun? To get a job? For a blog? The more granular you go - For a blog for developers who use JavaScript and know HTML that is about a library I really like - the narrower the scope, and the better you will be able to tailor your solution to fit!

# 3. Discover you inner creator

</Invert>

<Notes>

OUTCOMES:
    What it means "think like a creator", and how that lens/mindset can help you recognize opportunity

</Notes>

### Discussion

# What should you build?

<Notes>

  You now know why! Time for what most people consider to be the hard part. Let's make answering this question simpler for you.

</Notes>

---

## Heads up, it's ramble time.

---

<Steps>

* Thinking like a creator
* The scope of __new__
* Maximizing opportunity
* Picking the "What" that fits your "Why"

</Steps>


<Notes>

  Options for concrete examples:
   * Getting a job (or promotion, or client in your freelance)

  * Just like there is a mindset specific to, for example programming, there is a mindset of a creator. Once you harness, or recognize that mindset it is hard to turn off! The creator mindset* (obviously my opinion) is rooted in two human characteristic, 1) Observation and 2) Growth. A creator is one who uses their observation to uncover opportunity and with a mindset of growth understand the potential of that opportunity. Put another way, a creator is anyone who actively looks for opportunities for growth.

  * We has a human species understand, implicitly, concepts like: new, innovative, or different. The exist across domains. think back to our implicit concepts: new, innovative, or different. Those are results of growth. It doesn't matter what is growing, but growth results in any or all of the former.

  * So how do you know what to build? Adopt a creator mindset. Start looking at the world YOU live in as a set of unique unobserved opportunities. I'm confident you have problems.

  * You have carved out two very clarifying and bounding elements to ideas, the why and the whats. Picking the what that fits your "why" and that you have some reasonable vision of how to accomplish is where I would start. If you recognize an opportunity to build a massive skyscraper, and you know that providing homes for people is your why you want to build it seems a perfect match. Not sure about you, but I haven't the slightest idea about how to start that project. Picking what to start with can be difficult if you know how to do everything! One day you might get there and what a time that would be for you. Until then, start with the things you know, and just start.

  *Note: Staying away from other peoples visions will help with this as well. The more clarity you have, the more passion you bring, the more realistic and achievable the result is.

</Notes>

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let's exercise

Come up with 2 things in your home that are different than most other homes. Come up with 3 new ideas (regardless of the feasibility).

> get all 3!

# Question time!

What we covered.

* Thinking like a creator is simply being observant, and recognizing opportunity
* New doesn't have to be grand. It can be a simple improvment, or something that fits your Why better.
* Maximizing opportunity is the name of the game. The more you see, the more you try, the more likely you'll succeed!
* Picking what is the intersection of your why and your observable opportunity.
