# Getting the most of our time

<Steps>

  * ask questions
  * write things down

</Steps>

<Notes>

We have dedicated time to ask questions. I am here for you, so take advantage. If you have a question likely someone else has a question that is very similar

Writing will help actively engage your brain so you can practices our activies and challenge yourself.

## Let's get

# SELFISH ü¶û

<Notes>

Being a creator is such an odd mix of empathy and selfishness. So practice the one you have the hard time with. Often society promotes empathy and togetherness over all (which in many cases is better than selfishness. But as we will see, you build for you, so get selfish.

### Discussion

# Why are you building?

<Notes>

  Take a minute, write down why you think you are building

</Notes>

---

## Heads up, it's ramble time.

---

<Steps>

* What does "Build" mean?
* How does understanding __"Why"__ help?
* What should your project do?
* How do I find my __why__?

</Steps>


<Notes>

  Options for concrete examples:
   * writing for a blog
   * a specific product (keep more connected with my partner)

  * This leads us to believe that building 1) is meant for other people, 2) is supposed to make money, and 3) has to be hand crafted - usually with code. How do you want to define it for yourself

  * Helps you make decisions, with less effort. Relate possibly to values

  * Scope is often something that we as humans, creators, and dreamers have a hard time defining. What does our project do? It is a really hard question, and that question isn't static. You don't just decide on scope once, you constantly evaluate: What am I building? Is it the right thing? Should I add x feature now, later, or never? Should I stop this and pivot? I could go on. So how then do we keep focused?

  * Is it money? Is it for fun? To get a job? For a blog? The more granular you go - For a blog for developers who use JavaScript and know HTML that is about a library I really like - the narrower the scope, and the better you will be able to tailor your solution to fit!

### Discussion

# What should you build?

<Notes>

  You now know why! Time for what most people consider to be the hard part. Let's make answering this question simpler for you.

</Notes>

---

## Heads up, it's ramble time.

---

<Steps>

* Thinking like a creator
* The scope of __new__
* Maximizing opportunity
* Picking the "What" that fits your "Why"

</Steps>


<Notes>

  Options for concrete examples:
   * Getting a job (or promotion, or client in your freelance)

  * Just like there is a mindset specific to, for example programming, there is a mindset of a creator. Once you harness, or recognize that mindset it is hard to turn off! The creator mindset* (obviously my opinion) is rooted in two human characteristic, 1) Observation and 2) Growth. A creator is one who uses their observation to uncover opportunity and with a mindset of growth understand the potential of that opportunity. Put another way, a creator is anyone who actively looks for opportunities for growth.

  * We has a human species understand, implicitly, concepts like: new, innovative, or different. The exist across domains. think back to our implicit concepts: new, innovative, or different. Those are results of growth. It doesn't matter what is growing, but growth results in any or all of the former.

  * So how do you know what to build? Adopt a creator mindset. Start looking at the world YOU live in as a set of unique unobserved opportunities. I'm confident you have problems.

  * You have carved out two very clarifying and bounding elements to ideas, the why and the whats. Picking the what that fits your "why" and that you have some reasonable vision of how to accomplish is where I would start. If you recognize an opportunity to build a massive skyscraper, and you know that providing homes for people is your why you want to build it seems a perfect match. Not sure about you, but I haven't the slightest idea about how to start that project. Picking what to start with can be difficult if you know how to do everything! One day you might get there and what a time that would be for you. Until then, start with the things you know, and just start.

  *Note: Staying away from other peoples visions will help with this as well. The more clarity you have, the more passion you bring, the more realistic and achievable the result is.

</Notes>

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let's exercise

Come up with 2 things in your home that are different than most other homes. Come up with 3 new ideas (regardless of the feasibility).

# Question time!

What we covered.

* Thinking like a creator is simply being observant, and recognizing opportunity
* New doesn't have to be grand. It can be a simple improvment, or something that fits your Why better.
* Maximizing opportunity is the name of the game. The more you see, the more you try, the more likely you'll succeed!
* Picking what is the intersection of your why and your observable opportunity.

### Discussion

# Where should you start?

<Notes>

  You thought thinking of something to build was hard? This question is SUPER hard!

</Notes>

---

## Heads up, it's ramble time.

---

<Steps>

* A vision, your guide
* A problem and it's subject
* What is minimum?
* MVP

</Steps>


<Notes>

  Options for concrete examples:
    * A vision of providing transportation


  * A vision is the combination of your why your building and what your building. Likely, your vision is abstract and large. Having a vision doesn't mean that you have concrete steps to achieve your projects goals. What it provides is a map. A north star at which every decision is aimed. Starting requires concrete. So we first need to understand something concrete about our vision.

  * Often the first part of your vision that we can solidify is the target. The way we think about problems we also simultaneously think about the subject of that problem, who it effects. Usually that subject is us. If it isn't us find someone, or make someone up (called a persona) to be the subject for the problem. Remember we are trying to get concrete, the further away from yourself you place the subject of the problem, the more abstract. Finding you target is another block we can use to narrow our scope! With Why, What, and Who, we have more and more filters by which to pass our thoughts.

  * Having constructed a good mental model of your problem (The Why, What and Who) we can start to think about solving it. Again, your vision is large and abstract, to make something more solidify that vision into something tangible we have to start. So what should be the first word, line of code, action taken? It is hard to answer that question without a concrete end. Oddly enough starting abstract requires a concrete end. If we attempt to realize the entirety of your vision by planning the end more than likely we will never reach it. Visions are so abstract that multiple smaller problems/visions/spaces/milestones exist within it. Not considering that would be naive  and ultimately cause us to get invested in a concrete solution with no end. We would eventually loose momentum. To combat that we need to understand the smallest step we must take that 1) solves part of the problem, 2) allows us to understand more about the vision, and 3) create something concrete. This is usually called the MVP or minimum viable product.

<Notes>

  * Normally this anecdotal diagram would be frustrating. If your vision is to build a car, why you start with anything else? You'll just end up doing so much unnecessary work! When your vision is to provide transportation, this image brings some clarity. Every iteration of your project is providing value in alignment with your vision, providing transportation. Taking small pieces at a time (unclear in that image) allows us to build, deliver value, continuously learn and solidify more of our vision.

  * The question then becomes, what is the smallest piece of work you can accomplish? You want  something a select few people your target will adopt. Which means it needs to be usable from day 1. By now if you are thinking my vision is all or nothing, your vision is not abstract enough. There lies the issue with the image above (I'll drop that reference now ü§≠). A vision is not the what, a vision is the why. Wanting to build transportation, or more concretely a car, is not why. So if your vision isn't abstract enough, how would you go about making more abstract? Just ask you self why? Why do you want to see that vision? Just keep asking why until you see more possibilities than solutions.

</Notes>

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let's exercise

Find your vision! Abstract away from your project idea.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't have a vision, feel free to use transportation!

# Question time!

What we covered.

* A vision is the intersection of your why and your what, it's your north star
* Picking a target that is close to the source of the problem will help you stay focused.
* If you feel like the only solution is your idea, your vision isn't abstract enough
* Minimum is still about providing value, but the value you provide should still align with your vision

## Heads up, it's ramble time.

---

<Steps>

* It's all a guess
* Repetition, repetition, repe...
* Are you required?
* Where should you spend your time?

</Steps>


<Notes>

  Options for concrete examples:
    * thinking of 1 skill you are good at and one you want to delegate

  * remember building is always guessing. Make a hypothesis, sometimes you nail it, or completely miss the make. More often you'll be partially correct. If you can distil what you got correct and why, you've got something good.

  * We have determined what we can build that will deliver value, and bring us closer to achieving our vision. So how will we build it? What do we do once it's built? How do we know if we got it right, wrong or a mix? We have to get creative! Weird, the creator mindset goes in circles. You find an idea, within that idea you have to find more ideas üòÇ. Constant observation, constant opportunity evaluation. That is why it's a mindset, you can't really turn it off!

  * You are awesome! You have strengths! Often when you are working on a team our manager/leader will often understand our strengths better than us. When you are a creator you'll need to be more introspective and understand where you deliver the most value, and where you should delegate. (I hope you are seeing how these skills actually apply all around in life üôÇ). There are a lot of parts to shipping a project:

  - Design
  - User research
  - Marketing
  - Sales
  - Development
  - Brainstorming
  - etc...

  You are not a requirement in any of this. In the process of building the only purpose you serve is the physical incarnation of your vision. The physic who can translate the vision into actionable and inspiring leadership. But, you probably don't have a team of people ready to fulfill all of the roles required to build out your vision. So you'll have to do it yourself! Which is great, because you have so many skills, and the ones you are lacking you can learn. But should you? This is actually extremely difficult work, to let go of action in favour of delegation. Especially because this is usually to people outside your trusted network (otherwise you might be able to simply lead like mentioned about üòâ). If that is the case how do you understand where you should spend your time?

  * We can examine this problem like every other one we've discussed thus far, using our creator mindset. Which actions produce the most opportunity? There is a lot to that question, you'll have to have some vision for your life. Which skills provide the most opportunities for achieving your life goals? I, as an example, want to help people realize and capitalize their potential - that is my vision. Part of achieving that vision requires actually helping and interacting with people, which requires people to trust me. So how do I get people to trust me? Continuously show them the value I bring. But how do I do that if they don't know me? In the end I realized that I need visibility, the skills I posses allow me to get that visibility by creating products. But I only know how to develop. Which skills is it worth me learning?

  Can you still do those things that you've determined should be delegated? Definitely. Ultimately delegating on a project will cost money. Which means that if money isn't an available solution you'll have to take all the action. (Of course this isn't the only method to delegating Open Source Software is actually a good micro version of delegation).
